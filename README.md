## Description

GA-Pipelines is an application that runs Github-Actions, applies Cypress tests, and ensures the tests are run every time a merge request is made from the feature branch to the develop branch and from the develop branch to finally the main branch. 

If the all the tests pass, it should trigger a deploy hook that will deploy the latest version of the code once the merge request is committed to the main branch
